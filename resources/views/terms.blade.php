                <h5>14. GOVERNING LAW</h5>
                <p>These Terms will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore, without regard to conflict of law rules that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any dispute between the parties arising out of or relating to these Terms or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) that is not subject to arbitration will be resolved exclusively in the courts of the Republic of Singapore.</p>

                <h5>15. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h5>
                <p>The parties shall use their best efforts to engage directly to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. You agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration.</p>
                <p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins, then either party may initiate arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, including any question regarding their existence, validity or termination, shall be exclusively referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International Arbitration Centre ("SIAC Rules") for the time being in force, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of one arbitrator. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The agreement under these Terms is governed by the laws of the Republic of Singapore, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.</p>
                <p>The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. You and the Company agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>
                <p>You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out via email at hello@millionk.com with subject line LEGAL OPT OUT. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</p>
